# AWS KMS Terraform Module

Modules in Terraform are self-contained packages of Terraform configurations that are managed as a group. Modules are used to create reusable components in Terraform as well as for basic code organization. Please review the Terraform documentation to become familiar with Modules: https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/usage.html

This repo contains the following folder structure:

* [modules](./modules) contain several standalone, reusable, production-grade modules.
* [examples](./examples) contain examples that combine the modules in the `modules` folder to deploy real infrastructure.
